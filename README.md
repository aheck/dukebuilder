# Duke Builder

A basic Qt 6 desktop application built with Meson. Conan supplies Qt and emits
the native file Meson uses to find it.

## Requirements

- Conan 2
- Meson
- Ninja
- A C++17 compiler
- A configured and built `../libduke` checkout

Create a Conan profile once if you do not already have one:

```sh
conan profile detect
```

Install the dependencies and generate the Meson native file:

```sh
conan install . --output-folder=conan --build=missing -s build_type=Debug
```

Configure and build the application:

```sh
meson setup build --native-file conan/conan_meson_native.ini --buildtype debug
meson compile -C build
```

Run it:

```sh
./build/duke-builder
```

## 2D editor controls

- **Left click:** place connected wall vertices. Lines can be drawn at any angle.
- **Click the first vertex:** close the current shape and create a sector.
- **Right click or Enter:** finish the current line chain. It is kept only if its
  walls, together with existing walls, create a sector.
- **Backspace:** remove the last point from the active drawing.
- **Escape:** cancel the active drawing.
- **Middle-mouse drag:** pan the map.
- **Mouse wheel:** zoom around the cursor.
- **[ / ]:** decrease or increase the snapping grid size.
- **G or the Grid toolbar button:** show or hide the grid.
- **T:** enter Sprites mode.
- **Sprites mode:** right-click empty space to add a sprite; left-click or
  rubber-band to select; right-drag to move; right-click a sprite to choose its
  texture; Delete removes selected sprites.
- **Player start:** the permanent arrow can be selected and right-dragged only
  in Sprites mode; it has no selectable texture and is omitted from selections
  containing ordinary sprites.
- **Alt:** temporarily disable snapping while placing or previewing a point.

Drawing snaps to existing vertices before snapping to the grid. Sector fills are
shown when a chain is closed with three or more walls.

To add a neighboring sector, draw from existing boundary vertices and reuse a
complete boundary edge, or finish an open chain between existing vertices with
Enter. Boundaries shared by two sectors automatically become two-sided walls
and appear red; outer boundaries remain light gray. Shared vertices move both
sides together. Hover and selection highlighting still apply to either kind of
wall. Joining partway along an existing edge requires splitting that edge, which
is not yet supported.

For a release build, use `Release` for Conan's `build_type`, use `release` for
Meson's `--buildtype`, and configure a separate build directory.
